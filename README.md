## Added Features
Most of the features are carried over from the original source.
Few of the added features are:

- A launch category functionality, which launches every site in a category. Enter a category index number followed by `!`, i.e. `2!` would launch everything under the second category. 
- A "Quick Launch" functionality, which launches every site with `quickLaunch` property set to `true` upon entering `q!`.
- An invertible color theme. Either edit config or use `invert!` command.
- Show image or SVG as bookmark icon
- An option to show launch keys instead of icons. Either edit config or type `keys!`.
